## NLP_Movie_Review_Analysis

#### An application to distinguish positive and negative movie reviews based on NLP and ML

#### In preprocessing all the missing values are detected

#### In preprocessing also reviews that are blank text also are found and their indexes are saved in a list

#### A pipleline is built to first vectorize the text by TFIDF technique then load them to the model

#### The model is SVC where it classifies positive and negative comments

#### The performance of model is reasonable where it has almost %86 test accuracy and confusion matrix is showing acceptable performance on false positives nad false negative cases.
